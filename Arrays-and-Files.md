# _Describe concepts and characteristics of arrangements

## One-dimensional 

A one-dimensional array is a structured collection of components (often called array elements) that can be accessed individually by specifying the position of a component with a single index value. int number[50]; creates the number array which has 50 components, each capable of holding one int value.

## Multidimension
Concep of a data file The file system is the most viable aspect of an operating system. It provides the mechanism for on line storage of and access to both data and programs of the operating system and all the users of the computer system. The file system consists of two distinct parts: a collection of files, each storing related data, and directory structure, which organizes and provides information about all the files in the system. Some file systems have a third part, partitions, which are used to separate physically or logically large collection of directories.

Is an array with more than two dimensions. Each element is defined by two subscripts, the row index and the column index. Multidimensional arrays are an extension of 2-D matrices and use additional subscripts for indexing. 

# _Characteristics of files

## Multidimension
On a computer, every file is a long string of ones and zeros. Specifically, a file is a finite-length sequence of bytes, where each byte is an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive. Files can be broadly classified as either binary or text. These categories have different characteristics and need different tools to work with such files.
